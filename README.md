# Outcast
Modpack Developed on the Curseforge website

 Nature has had enough. It will fight you every step of the way. From chickens to villagers, be prepared to fight. How long will you survive? Oh by the way, there is no magic in this land.

 

This pack will require you to defend yourself from Mother Nature's creatures. You will need to survive against Blood Moons, Infernal Mobs and chickens...... Yes Chickens. 

 

 

This is a heavily tech modded pack with mods such as Thermal Expansion, Ender IO and advanced Generators, etc.  There are storage mods such as Applied Energistics 2, Better Chests, Refined Relocation, etc.

 

You can protect your base with mods like Portal Gun and Tinkers' Mechworks.
